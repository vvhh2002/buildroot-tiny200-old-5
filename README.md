# Buildroot Package for Widora TINY200
Opensource BSP for Widora TINY200 boards and Allwinner F1C100s / F1C200s

## Install

### Install necessary packages
```
sudo apt install wget unzip build-essential git bc swig libncurses-dev libpython3-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt install pkg-config zlib1g-dev libusb-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt install python3-distutils
```

### Download BSP
**Notice: Root permission is not necessery for download or extract.**
```
git clone https://github.com/aodzip/buildroot-tiny200
```

## Make the first build
**Notice: Root permission is not necessery for build firmware.**

### Apply defconfig
**Caution: Apply defconfig will reset all buildroot configurations to default values. Generally, you only need to apply it once.**
```
cd buildroot-tiny200
make widora_tiny200_defconfig
```

### Regular build
```
make
```

## Speed up build progress

### Download speed
Buildroot will download sourcecode when compiling the firmware. If your network connection is slow, please contact Widora to purchase a TF card with the necessary "dl" files. All profits will be used for the development and maintenance of this project.

### Compile speed
If you have a multicore CPU, you can try
```
make -j ${YOUR_CPU_COUNT}
```
or buy a powerful PC for yourself.

## Build sunxi-tools
```
git clone https://github.com/Icenowy/sunxi-tools.git -b f1c100s-spiflash
cd sunxi-tools
make 
sudo make install
```

## Helper Scripts
 - fel-uboot.sh: Run U-Boot in RAM by FEL mode.
 - fel-linux.sh: Run the whole firmware in RAM by FEL mode.
 - flash-mmc-all.sh: Flash sysimage-sdcard.img to /dev/sdb
 - flash-nor-all.sh: Flash sysimage-flash.img to nor flash by FEL mode.
 - rebuild-uboot.sh: Recompile U-Boot when you direct edit U-Boot sourcecode.
 - rebuild-kernel.sh: Recompile Kernel when you direct edit Kernel sourcecode.

## For F1C100s
If your board can't boot up kernel. For example, uboot hang at
```
Starting kernel ...
```
Slow down `CONFIG_DRAM_CLK` in `uboot.defconfig`, for example
> Change
> ```
> CONFIG_DRAM_CLK=240
> ```
> To
> ```
> CONFIG_DRAM_CLK=156
> ```
If you have already compiled U-Boot, the method above mostly won't work. Try **ONE** of method below.
- Delete `output/build/uboot-2020.07` and recompile.
- run `make uboot-menuconfig` and change `sunxi dram clock speed` in `ARM architecture` and recompile.
